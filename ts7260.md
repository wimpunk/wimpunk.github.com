## Index

These page is about the stuff I missed/needed/forgot about [the TS-7260](http://www.embeddedarm.com/products/board-detail.php?product=TS-7260).  It's just all about stuff I stumbled with.
It should always be reachable at [http://ts7260.tisnix.be/](http://ts7260.tisnix.be/) which will be a redirect to the current location.

* [kernel compiling](#kernel): you need to recompile the kernel
  if you want to use the I2C-patch or the serial-patch.
* [I2C patch](#i2c): this patch makes it possible to use
  the GPIO pinheader as a bit-banging I2C device.
* [bat3](#bat3): the bat3 code to control the TS-BAT3 missed
  some features.  This is a try to add them.
* [fconfig](#fconfig): redboot can be used while booting but
  you can also manipulate the setting while running linux.
* [serial](#serial): by default the kernel only supports 6 COM
  ports.  This patch fixes this issue.
* [kernel26](kernel 2.6): some notes on how to compile a 2.6
  kernel for ts-7260

If you think I could help you, you can always try to contact me at
wimpunk+ts7260 at gmail dot com.  If my spamfilter isn't to aggresive
you'll get an answer.</p>

## Kernel Compiling

My kernel patches are patches against the default kernel provided by
Technology Systems.  These are the steps you need to take to get your
kernel compiled:

* Extract <a href="ftp://ftp.embeddedarm.com/ts-arm-sbc/ts-7260-linux/sources/tskernel-2.4.26-ts11-src.tar.gz">the embedded arm kernel</a>:
    `tar -xvzf tskernel-2.4.26-ts11-src.tar.gz`
* After extracting the kernel you can patch it with either
   my <a href="i2c-patch">i2c-patch</a> or
   my <a href="serial.patch">serial.patch</a>
   or you could apply both </li>
* Fix the crosscompile issue.  By default the TS-kernel expects
   to find the crosscompiler on something like
   `../../tools/crosstool/arm-9tdmi-linux-gnu/gcc-3.3.4-glibc-2.3.2/bin/`
   but I think most people didn't installed their crosscompiler there.
   Mine didn't even had that name.  You can either change the Makefile
   or add CROSS_COMPILE to as a make parameter.</li>
* Import the old configuration:

        cp ./arch/arm/def-configs/ts7260 .config
        make oldconfig

* Compile the kernel:

        make menuconfig
        make bzImage
        make modules

Note: The current 2.4 kernel doesn't compile with gcc-4.0.1 - at least not
the one I tried.

## I2C patch

This patch is all about using GPIO as a bitbanging I2C controller.
Get the <a href="i2c-patch">i2c-patch</a> and patch the kernel:

    cd linux24 && patch -p1 & i2c-patch

Enable i2c by running `make menuconfig`.  You can find the option
on: character devices &gt; I2C support &gt; I2C bit-banging interfaces &gt;
Ep93xx I2C using GPIO pins.

Feel free to post your comment
[here](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ts-7000/message/5886) or
you could post them on [a google group](http://groups.google.com/group/ts-i2c-patch")
or contact me directly at wimpunk+ts7260 at gmail dot com.

I've been testing the patch on a TS7260. I load the module as
`insmod i2c-ep93xx [sda=sdapin] [scl=sclpin]`
with optional params sda and scl.  Default values are set at compiletime.

# bat3

* It's all in googlecode: see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bat3/">the bat3 site on google code</a>
* Original messages about the bat3 can be found <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ts-7000/message/6104">on the ts-7000 forum on yahoo</a>
* I've opened a googlegroup: check <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/bat3-discuss">bat3 discuss</a>

# Modifying ts-kernel for more than 6 ports

The default kernel only uses 6 ports but I needed more.
There is a
<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ts-7000/message/11697">post</a>
about this in the yahoo group and I created
<a href="serial.patch">serial.patch</a> to fix it.

<a name="kernel26"></a>Compiling a 2.6 kernel
A while ago I discovered [the linux-2.6 from ynezz](git://github.com/ynezz/linux-2.6.git)
and decided to give it a try.  These are my basic notes about my tries

* Get the code from the repo
* Make a default configuration

       make ARCH=arm ts72xx_defconfig

* Enable serial console:

       CONFIG_SERIAL_8250=y <br />
       CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE=y

* Compile the modules:

       make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=$(pwd)/../modules modules_install

* Load the kernel:

       load -b 0x00218000 -m http -h 192.168.1.12 /tmp/vmlinux
       exec -c "console=ttyAM0,115200 root=/dev/tssda1"

I used an openwrt image build earlier to test the kernel.  Seemed to work pretty
good.  My openwrt config will be posted later.
