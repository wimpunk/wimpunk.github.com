# Pro
* Almost all programs work the same way. At least if they are folowing the code
  styles. Others like NetBeans doesn't which make copy/paste a little strange.
* Timemachine is a wonderful backup program which just works and does what you
  need as a backup solution

# Contra
* The filesystem isn't case sensitive
