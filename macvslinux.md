# Pro
* Almost all programs work the same way. At least if they are folowing the code
  styles. Others like NetBeans doesn't which make copy/paste a little strange.
* Timemachine is a wonderful backup program which just works and does what you
  need as a backup solution
* iCalendar is a nice calendar application. I like it more than google calendar.
  The day overview also shows you the rest of the application. It's a form
  I like.

# Contra
* The filesystem isn't case sensitive
* Hamster is (currently) not working.  And I like it very much to do my
  timetracking.
