While I was trying to get [my own docker working][TestingJekyll] I stumbled on
devcontainers for visual code. A little google showed me [this][MartingPeck]
which seems to be the answer to my question.  Same info at 
[bosewell's blog][RobseWellBlog].  My current test seems to work fine but 
I have to update my Jekyll environment since the posts aren't rendered yet.
